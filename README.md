# RollOrBust

## Description

PyDiceGame is a simple multiplayer dice rolling game implemented in Python. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a total score of 100 or more points. Players take turns rolling a six-sided die, accumulating points with each roll. However, rolling a 1 resets the player's current score to zero. The game supports 2 to 6 players, providing an enjoyable experience for friends and family alike.

## Usage

To play PyDiceGame:
1. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
2. Enter the number of players (2-6) when prompted.
3. Each player takes turns rolling the dice by inputting 'y' to roll or any other key to pass.
4. The game continues until one player accumulates 100 or more points, at which point they are declared the winner.
